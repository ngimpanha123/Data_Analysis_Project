# Project: Condo for Sale in Cambodia

This project aims to analyze and predict the prices of condos for sale in Cambodia using data science techniques. It involves web scraping, data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, and decision making. The project was conducted as part of the Programming for Data Science course at the Institute of Technology of Cambodia.

## Project Description and Objective

The objective of this project is to provide insights into the condo market in Cambodia and develop a predictive model for condo prices. The project focuses on identifying the key variables that influence condo prices and using machine learning techniques to create a model that can accurately predict condo prices based on these variables.

## Dataset and Variable Description

The dataset used in this project was obtained by scraping data from the Khmer 24 website, specifically the section dedicated to condos for sale in Cambodia. The dataset consists of 1547 rows and 15 columns, representing various features related to the condos.

## Data Preprocessing

Before conducting the analysis, the dataset underwent several preprocessing steps. This included dropping irrelevant features, checking for missing values, handling duplicates, and filling in missing values using appropriate techniques. Categorical features were also encoded, and outliers were identified and removed.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory data analysis was performed to gain insights into the dataset and understand the relationships between variables. Various visualizations, such as heatmaps, pie charts, and price variations, were used to analyze the distribution and patterns within the data.

## Feature Engineering

Feature engineering involved creating new features and transforming existing ones to improve the predictive power of the models. This included dummy encoding categorical variables and scaling the data.

## Model Selection and scoring of performance

Several machine learning models were trained and evaluated for their performance in predicting condo prices. The models used in this project include:

1. Linear Regression Model
2. Decision Tree Regressor Model
3. Random Forest Regressor Model
4. AdaBoost Regressor Model
5. Gradient Boosting Regressor Model
6. LGMB Regressor Model
7. XGB Regressor Model
8. CatBoost Regressor Model
9. Lasso Regressor Model

The models were compared based on their performance metrics to select the best model for the given task.

## Decision Making to Choose one Model

Based on the evaluation results, the Gradient Boosting Regressor model was chosen as the best model for predicting condo prices. However, the final decision depends on specific requirements and priorities, such as achieving the highest testing score or reducing mean square error.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of data science techniques in analyzing and predicting condo prices in Cambodia. By leveraging web scraping, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model selection, valuable insights were gained into the condo market. The selected model can be used to make predictions on future condo prices, aiding potential buyers and sellers in making informed decisions.
